open 1153_1_supp_mat_highwire_zip_3396_mzgbl4.zip 

unzip 1135_0_supp_mat_highwire_zip_3418_mzrbyr

open 

and then .... 

	extract the files
	read the manifest file to see what's in there

	for each <filename> rename that fila as article_id_title, where title is derived from the manifest xml 

	take the pdf identified by title "Merged PDF" and the main POA xml
		rename the pdf as according to instructions from Tina

		we will use elife_poa_e000213.pdf as the name of the PDF
		the parent xml file will be elife_poa_e000213.xml (which I can make)

		take the xml and the PDF, put them into a zip file
			elife_poa_YYYYMMDD.zip 

		You can put as many pdf & xml coples into that file for delivery on that date as we wish. 

		deliver that with a go.xml file. 

		send the elife_poa_YYYYMMDD.zip 

		send the data supplements

		the data supplements
			we have to send these per article
			filename is elife_poa_e000_ds.zip 
				this contains the files and a manifest.xml file 
				the manifest file contains a pointer to the zip file with all of the supp files
				the manifest file points to the suppfile zip file and the title 
				in the manifext file containst the names of the files in the zip file 

				the zip file can be called anything we like, but we should call it something sensible 

		and finally send the go.xml file 
			the go.xml file has no internal data, it's just it's presesne tells HW to process the contents of the
			ftp directory 

- unpack files from EJP and rename them.
